            <p class="text-container">Web development involves creating websites and web applications that can be
                accessed through the
                internet. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two essential
                technologies used in web development.

                HTML is a markup language used to structure the content of a web page. It provides the foundation for
                creating web pages by defining the structure and meaning of the content. HTML is used to create various
                elements of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. It is a standard markup
                language that is understood by web browsers and ensures that web pages are displayed consistently across
                different devices and platforms.
            </p>

                CSS, on the other hand, is a style sheet language used to define the visual appearance and layout of the
                content on a web page. It allows developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content,
                making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website. CSS is used to style and format various
                elements of a web page, such as font size, color, layout, and overall visual design. It can be used to
                create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes, such as those of mobile devices.

                Together, HTML and CSS work in tandem to create visually appealing and functional websites that can be
                accessed by anyone with an internet connection. HTML provides the structure and meaning of the content,
                while CSS provides the visual design and layout. They are the foundation of web development and are used
                by developers and designers alike to create everything from simple web pages to complex web
                applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                In conclusion, HTML and CSS are two of the most important tools in web development, allowing developers
                to create visually appealing and functional websites and web applications. Their versatility and ease of
                use make them essential for anyone interested in building a strong online presence.
